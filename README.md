Unity3D: VR Sports (f22-23) <br/>
Maintainer: Hunter Smith <br/>
Answers: <br/>

  Issue 1: <br/>
    Developers (Github account in parentheses): Cam Zoloty (camzoloty), Johnathan Reilly (jr645920), Jake Costello (Jake-Costello) <br/>

    Project Description: Develop a game or software with a team to strengthen collaboration and usage of software tools.
    Expected Final Deliverable: Create a VR game of a batting cage simulation where the user can interact with menu to change speed and type of pitch to hit. If time allows, add variety of other sports.

    Target Technology: VR Headsets, specifically in use with Meta Platforms' Quest 2.0

    Time Slots: Monday 1-6pm, Wednesday 5-7pm

    Compiling, deploying, running app: Unity 3D uses its own compiler and creates the project in itself, we then have to go to project settings in Unity 3D, and install the VR support in Unity to use in accordance to our project.

  Issue 2:<br/>

  Tools: <br/>
    - VS Code: This will be our text editor for the project. It will allow us to have a better workflow of C# code. <br/>
    - Unity 3D: The main part of the project will revolve around the implementation of Unity 3D. We will be using this tool to build our VR game and it will serve as our base.
    <br/>
    - Blender: This is a tool that will allow our group to create simple 3D models for Unity, in turn making our game come to life.
    <br/>
    - GitHub: This will aid our collaboration and allow us to effectively communicate our coding progress throughout the project.

  Roles: <br/>
    - All: <br/>
        - Take Unity courses and tutorial and become comfortable with it <br/>
        - Figure out the basics of C#
        - Figure out what everyone is interested in doing for the project
        - Search for best possible headstart codebasesâ€‹

  To-Do List:
    - Get more comfortable with Unity 3D
    - Search for assets and other things that will benefit us in the beginning
    - Communicate with each other and what we're doing to advance the project

How to didvide roles effictively:

While getting comfortable with unity course, also look at what interests you and what you would like to take as your part of the project.

Also for blender if you are particularly interested in doing the blender portion let the team know so we can assign workload earlier rather than leater.

Finally decide who is documenting the process and make sure files are backed up in case mistakes are made.
